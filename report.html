This report contains the stages that were required to achieving an
effective static website that met the specification for the Internet
Application Protocol module. The purpose of this module was to develop
responsive static website that used HTML, CSS, XML, JavaScript and the
possible use of other query languages like jQuery to enhance the quality of
the website. </p> <h1>     Planning </h1> <p>     My webpage consists of a
navigation that links between HTML, XML and     JavaScript pages. </p> <ul>
<li>         <strong>             Navigation, Structure (nav top, header,
slideshow, content)         </strong>         <br/>         The navigation bar
was developed using HTL and CSS. It uses a href link         that opens up the
page that it’s linked to.<br> A few media query were used         to enable the
navigation to be responsive.<strong></strong>     </li>     <li>
<strong> The header image has
a background that has been blurred and burnt             using Photoshop with
heading text and         </strong>     </li> </ul> <h2>     Designing Slider
</h2> <p>     The following diagram below shows the planning phase of my
slideshow. While     developing the slideshow I had to improve on what I was
taught during the     lecture and labs. My slideshow consists of a variables
that stores integers     and strings in arrays that hold the position of both
the caption and image     files. I created a set image function that ran
through the array selecting     the position of each image in the root folder,
storing and then displaying     it in a HTML tag. </p> <p>     I used a
similar system to create my thumbnails by creating a variable that     changed
the value of the while being clicked. To ensure my slider ran
automatically I used a set interval function to move between the images. At
first this was hard because the variables wouldn’t display the images in
HTML or it would move to the wrong position in the array. After gaining
good enough of an understand on how to implement the change in position of
the array, I went on to further develop features that would move to the
start, end and select a random image in the thumbnail using the
“math.random()” function. </p> <h1>     Implemented Functionality </h1> <h2>
Slide show </h2> <p>     <br/>     The logic behind the development of a
slideshow wasn’t new to me as I     understood what was expected when it was
introduced during labs and     lectures, but the further development of adding
captions and thumbnails     were. While developing my slide show I upgraded
the knowledge I obtained     during lectures and labs then expanded on the
development. </p>
 <h2>     XML page </h2> <p>

</figure>



 I used XSL/XSLT to style the
contents of my XML page. The XSL consisted a     styles sheet and JavaScript
files that were used to develop styles to     ensure the page maintains its
fluid responsiveness. Furthermore I used     xPath and XQuery within the XSL
page to make queries that selected     specifics tags within the XML page.
Also I made further implementations     that used mathematical logic to
selective display tags from the XML page.     An example would the use of &lt;
and &gt; symbols to decide the products     being displayed from the XML file
depending if it’s less than 500 pounds.     My XML page displays the
navigation and the header properly and maintains     responsiveness for
multiply devices. Underneath the header it displays     featured products and
their prices using XML, XSL, xPath and CSS. After the     featured page there
are products being displayed depending if they are less     than or greater
than a certain value.
 </p> <p>     At the end of my XML page I have two
sections that display other products     using a mixture of XQuery and
JavaScript. I developed a slider that     horizontally shows a list of the
available products, by displaying their     “title”, “year” and price. Left
and right buttons were added to move     between the products. </p> <p>
Furthermore I did a query that displayed all the available products in an
archive method but unfortunately time did not permit me to full complete
the functionality of this section. My aim was to have a table that if the
user’s inputs a range of condition it would highlight the product depending
the condition the user input. </p> <p>     In addition the benefits of using
XSL is that unlike XML is allows HTML     tags and it works well with CSS and
JavaScript tags. XML is a very     difficult language to work with because
it’s strict and doesn’t really     provide a lot of features to develop an
efficient website. </p> <h2>     Responsive Stylesheet </h2> <p>     The
styling of the website was made responsive by using google chrome to     test
how it would look when resized. It was a long process and required. </p> <h2>
Reasoning behind Website design </h2> <p>    
<figure style="display:table; float:left; ">
<img src="img/nike.jpg" width="400"  />
<figcaption style=" display: table-caption;
  caption-side: bottom;"> Nike Dunk CMFT, Colour scheme that inspired the website styling</figcaption>
</figure>
While developing my website I
was inspired by the Nike Dunk CMFT off-whites     collaboration edition,
mostly because the black brings out the red making     the style and fashion
very distinctive eye catching and memorable. As a web     developer my main is
to develop a websites and application that are     attractive but also unique.
This style uses two colours and some maybe     consider not compatible but due
to its unorthodox distinctiveness it’s     become a very memorable design. I
used red, more specifically “B93A32 “ and     black “#000000” as the two main
distinctive styles implemented within my     website. There are also shades of
grey and white to make the website     distinctive. </p> <p>     The colour
pallet below shows a popular combination of colours that     consists or red,
black, yellow and purple. Although I didn’t implement any     use of purple
within my website I’m happy with knowing that the use of red,     black and
orange are popular themes among other web designers.
     While developing my website I came across a lot of challenges
within the     validation stage of the development. Although I had a small
understanding     of JavaScript implementing my acquired knowledge was more
stressful than     expected. I overcame this issue by attending the labs to
practise as much     as possible and used a lot of books to gain outside
knowledge. </p><br /> <p>     The first issue I came across while developing this
website occurred when I     tried to use JavaScript to create a slideshow. I
understood the logic     required to complete this task from the labs and
lecture but while I tried     implementing it certain functions within the
JavaScript while weren’t     working. I solved this issue by using the google
chrome console mode to do     a lot of error checking and realised it was
mostly missing semicolons, lack     of closing braces and not declaring
variables properly. </p> <p>     Furthermore, I experienced a lot of
challenges while trying to developing     the thumbnails mostly because I had
to return a lot of values from the     JavaScript to be displayed and styles
using HTML plus CSS. </p> <p>     Secondly, I found the use of form validation
to be simple and straight     forward to I did a lot experimenting to push and
challenge myself to ensure     my checkout had similar features to an actually
ecommerce or shopping     website. </p> <p>     Developing the captcha was
very challenging to the point that I felt like     not completing it or using
captcha API. But after making improvements to     other parts of my website I
learnt how to generate random values while     developing a function that
would display a random image within my     slideshow. I used this logic with a
lot of with a lot of teaching materials     on the w3school website I was able
to figure out to implement a functioning     captcha. </p>  <h1>     Testing </h1> <p>

While developing using JavaScript to develop this website I encountered a
lot of errors that prevented some features from functioning. This caused me
to conduct multiply tests that ensured the functionality and usability of
the website met the requirements. </p> <p>     The table below contains the
test that were done to ensure the website     functioned as required: </p>

<p>     In
conclusion, because this was my first time ever using XML I found it very
frustrating because its method of development to complete certain tasks
required a lot of coding in comparison to other web development languages
that completed the same tasks like PHP and SQL. One of the first problems I
had with XML was trying to style it. This was because the web page wouldn’t
display if an error occurred and most compiling errors in the console never
really identified the issue preventing the web page from displaying. After
learning XSTL and fairly understanding the fundaments required to
converting XML to HTML by styling with XSL and CSS my experience with XML
went a lot smoother. </p>
